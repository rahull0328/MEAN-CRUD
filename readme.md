---

Welcome to the **MEAN-CRUD** project! This is a simple and powerful CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application built using the MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express, AngularJS, Node.js) — focusing primarily on the **backend** with **MongoDB**, **Express**, and **Mongoose**.

> ⚙️ Built with simplicity, structured for scalability, and spiced up with a touch of elegance.

## 🧰 Prerequisites

Before you get started, make sure you have the following installed:

- 🟢 [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) – JavaScript runtime
- 🍃 [MongoDB Compass](https://www.mongodb.com/products/compass) – Visual GUI for MongoDB 🧩 *(Required for viewing & managing your database)*
- 🔌 [MongoDB Server](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) – MongoDB must be running locally or remotely
- 🚂 [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) – Fast, minimalist web framework for Node.js
- 🧬 [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/) – Elegant MongoDB object modeling for Node.js

Make sure MongoDB is running either via Compass or the command line before starting the server.
